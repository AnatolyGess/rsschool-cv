                have a younger sister and I want to show her what it is like to really live, to visit many countries, to
                find out how others live. In order to achieve the implementation of the above, I need capital, on which
                I can implement this. At the end of the 2nd year of my college, I realized who I want to be - a
                programmer; this gave me an idea of the direction in which it is necessary to move in order to achieve
                the goal, and I will do my best to make my plan come true.</li>
